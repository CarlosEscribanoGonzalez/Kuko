# Kuko

**Kuko** is my second participation in a game jam and my first project using **Unity**, started just a week after my first contact the engine. It is a **platformer game** presented for a game jam organized by **Game Scholars**, a student association at **Rey Juan Carlos University**.

### About the Project

The theme of the game jam was **"medieval,"** and the timeframe for developing the game was 20 days. This project allowed me to apply my newly acquired Unity skills and gain experience in game development within a collaborative environment.

### Features
- Platformer gameplay with medieval themes.
- Developed in Unity.
- Created within a 20-day timeframe for the game jam.

### Technologies
- **Unity**
